## Hey there!

The main goal here is just to
do doing some classic programming workouts!

## The Challenge

First clone this repository and install the packages. If you don't have it already, you'll need to install the latest version of NodeJS. Then open up the terminal and run `npm test`.

##### The challenge is to make all the tests pass.

Once the unit tests pass, commit your code to your own git branch and submit a pull request.
