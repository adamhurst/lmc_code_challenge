## Hey there!

The main goal here is just to
do doing some classic programming workouts!

## The Challenge is to fix index.js so all the tests pass

First open up the terminal, clone this repository, navigate to it and install the package by typing `npm install`. After the installation is done, just run `npm test`. You'll see lots of red error messages. The challenge is to fix the code in `index.js` until everything nice and green :) 
If you don't have it already, you'll need to install the latest version of NodeJS. 

#### Once the unit tests pass, commit your code to your own git branch and submit a pull request.
